    <h3>Home Page : Introduction to Robotics and applications</h3>
    <p>
        Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that merges engineering, computer science, and technology to create
        machines capable of performing various tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These robots are often
        programmed to perform specific tasks, such as assembling products on a factory line, assisting in surgeries, or
        even exploring distant planets. Robotics has opened new possibilities for industries, healthcare, exploration,
        and personal use, leading to innovation in sectors that previously relied heavily on manual labor.
        <br /><br />In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor technologies
        have greatly enhanced the capabilities of robots. They are no longer just machines following preset
        instructions, but autonomous systems capable of learning, adapting, and interacting with their environment. From
        robotic arms in manufacturing to drones in agriculture, the world of robotics is rapidly evolving and has become
        a critical part of modern society.

    <h3>Robots in Industry: Key Advancements in Industrial Automation</h3>
    <p>
        Robots are revolutionizing industrial sectors by automating processes that previously required human labor. The
        most common types of industrial robots include robotic arms, which are widely used in the automotive,
        electronics, and consumer goods industries. These machines can perform tasks with precision, speed, and
        endurance beyond human capabilities, such as welding, painting, assembling, and packaging.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to reducing production time and costs, industrial robots can work in hazardous environments where
        human safety might be at risk, such as in handling toxic materials or working in extreme temperatures. As the
        demand for mass production grows, robots are becoming essential for maintaining the pace and quality required in
        modern manufacturing. The future of industrial robots includes increased collaboration between robots and
        humans, with robots assisting workers in complex tasks that require high-level decision-making.

    <h3>Robots in Industry: Key Advancements in Industrial Automation</h3>
    <p>
        Humanoid robots are robots designed to resemble and mimic human behavior, both in appearance and functionality.
        These robots are capable of performing tasks traditionally reserved for humans, such as assisting in healthcare,
        customer service, and education. The defining characteristic of humanoid robots is their ability to interact
        with humans in a natural and intuitive way, using advanced algorithms for speech recognition, facial expression
        interpretation, and decision-making.
        <br /><br />
        Some of the most well-known humanoid robots include robots like ASIMO, Sophia, and Atlas, which have been
        designed for various purposes, from assisting the elderly and disabled to performing dangerous tasks in
        disaster-stricken areas. Humanoid robots are also becoming an integral part of research and development, where
        they help scientists better understand human cognition, biomechanics, and social interaction. With continued
        advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics, humanoid robots are expected to become more autonomous,
        capable of learning from experience, and performing increasingly complex tasks in the future.
